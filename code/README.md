- IDE: Jupyter Notebook

There are five IPython notebooks implemented for this project.
Each notebook can be run independently.
To reproduce the results for a specific section, run the corresponding notebook.

data_preprocessing.ipynb : containing code for data preprocessing.
logistic_regression.ipynb : containing code for implementing logistic regression models.
svm.ipynb : containing code for implementing support vector machine models.
random_forest.ipynb : containing code for implementing random forest models.
ann.ipynb : containing code for implementing artificial neuron models.

The dataset folder contains three csv files:
creditcard.csv : The original dataset from Kaggle.
training.csv : The training set generated after data preprocessing. 
testing.csv : The testing set generated after data preprocessing.
