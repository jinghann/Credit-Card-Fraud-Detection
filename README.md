## Programming language: Python
## IDE: Jupyter Notebook

### There are five IPython notebooks implemented for this project.
Each notebook can be run independently.
To reproduce the results for a specific section, run the corresponding notebook.

+ data_preprocessing.ipynb : containing code for data preprocessing.
+ logistic_regression.ipynb : containing code for implementing logistic regression models.
+ svm.ipynb : containing code for implementing support vector machine models.
+ random_forest.ipynb : containing code for implementing random forest models.
+ ann.ipynb : containing code for implementing artificial neuron models.

### The dataset folder contains three csv files:
creditcard.csv : The original dataset from Kaggle.
training.csv : The training set generated after data preprocessing. 
testing.csv : The testing set generated after data preprocessing.
