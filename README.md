# CZ4032-Data-Mining-and-Analytics
## Programming language: Python
## IDE: Jupyter Notebook

### There are five IPython notebooks implemented for this project.
Each notebook can be run independently.
To reproduce the results for a specific section, run the corresponding notebook.

+ data_preprocessing.ipynb : containing code for data preprocessing.
+ logistic_regression.ipynb : containing code for implementing logistic regression models.
+ svm.ipynb : containing code for implementing support vector machine models.
+ random_forest.ipynb : containing code for implementing random forest models.
+ ann.ipynb : containing code for implementing artificial neuron models.

### Dataset
#### Download the credit card transaction dataset from Kaggle website as creditcard.csv
+ https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

#### Create a folder named dataset under code folder, which will contain the following files:
+ creditcard.csv : The original dataset from Kaggle.
+ training.csv : The training set generated after data preprocessing. 
+ testing.csv : The testing set generated after data preprocessing.
